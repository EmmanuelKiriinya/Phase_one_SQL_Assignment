## Overview
In this project, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by different countries across several categories. Obtain the international debt file from <a href = https://github.com/LuxDevHQ/Data-Analytics-Boot-camp-Projects/blob/main/international_debt_with_missing_values.csv> international_debt_with_missing_values. <a/><br/>
The following dataset has the following columns:
- country_name varchar
- country_code varchar
- indicator_name varchar

  This dataset will help us answer questions like; which country has the highest total debt and the most common debt indicator.
